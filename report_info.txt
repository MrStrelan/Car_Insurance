EDA complete. We displayed:
- Dataset info, missingness, numeric and categorical summaries.
- Histograms for ClaimNb, ClaimOccur, ClaimRate.
- Distributions for numeric features (1st–99th pct clipped).
- log(1+Density) histogram.
- Frequency bar charts for categorical features (Area, VehBrand, VehGas, Region).
Exported compact feature summary to: data/eda_compact_summary.csv

(A) ClaimRate → ClaimNb (0.26)
This is expected since ClaimRate = ClaimNb / Exposure.
Ignore for model insight.
(B) Exposure (0.07)
Policies that are insured longer have more chance to claim → correct & expected.
Not a true predictor, but an offset factor.
(C) BonusMalus (0.05)
This is the most meaningful predictor in the dataset.
BonusMalus summarizes historical driving behavior:
Low Bonus → safe driver
High Bonus → risky driver
Even a small correlation is meaningful due to data imbalance.
(D) VehAge (0.02)
Older vehicles show slightly more claims.
Weak linearly, but ML models normally find more in nonlinear splits.
(E) DrivAge (0.01)
Claims often have a U-shape with driver age:
young drivers → risky
middle age → safest
elderly → rising risk again
Linear correlation cannot capture a U-shape, so this low number is expected.
(F) Density (0.01)
Urban areas → more traffic → more accidents.
But again, relationship is nonlinear, so correlation underestimates importance.
VehPower (0.0046)
Barely correlates linearly, but tree-based models often find it important.
Possible explanation: power interacts with driver profile - bonus/malus.
